# TOp_100_US_Companies
Wanted to try my hands again on MS Excel having used PowerBI for most of my data analysis and dashboard building.
The data was sourced from kaggle and shows the largest companies in the US by revenue for the year 2022.
#New Attribute:
I created a slicer to enable any user filter by the company's name using their first alphabets. Thus, should you have your eyes for a particular company of interest, just click on the alphabet "A" if Apple, to see their details.
Yes, this would have been really smooth on PowerBI, but Excel made it even exciting.

Outcomes:
Total Revenue by these 100 companies: USD 10.5Million.
Average Revenue for the 100 companies: USD 104k.
Total employess for the 100 companies: 16.6 Million.

Texas, California and D.C had the top most footprint of companies with the highest Revenue.
Retail and health care Industries were the top 2 in the 1 -25th position.
Transportation  and Financial services Industries were the top 2 in the 26 -50th position.
Retail and Aerospace  Industries were the top 2 in the 51 -75th position.
Retail and Food Industries were the top 2 in the 76 to 100th position.
